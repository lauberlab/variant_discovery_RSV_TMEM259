## Meta-analysis
This folder contains the R script that was used to conduct the meta-analysis of IRIS1+2+3 vs. LoewenKIDS. It uses the R package [meta](https://github.com/guido-s/meta/).

## Colocalization analysis
This folder contains the R script that was used to conduct the co-localization analysis. It uses the R package [coloc](https://github.com/chr1swallace/coloc).
